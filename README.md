### Goal and Value of the Application
My application is an online market where you can buy fresh fruit. 

### Usability Principles Considered
I organized my website into three columns. The far left is the filters and sorting options, the middle column is the fruit options, and the far right is the cart. The cart has a fixed position on the top right so that users can keep track of what they have added no matter how far down they have scrolled. 

### Organization of Components
I used Ant design for the basis of all my components including the card component, space, and the buttons.
